In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Then to start the app:

### `npm start`

The react app should run in port 8081.

The admin user should have an additional item in the nav bar that allows them to go to the "Admin Dashboard" which will have a list of functions only available to admin users. These do not have an functionality, but the logic is in place to continue to build upon them.

Regular users will not have access to these, but they will have access to pages with reports, channels, etc. There is some logic in place for the sub-admin, but currently, there is no functionality in place.
